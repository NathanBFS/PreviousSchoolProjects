PreviousSchoolProjects
======================

This repository contains some of my past classwork from my studies at Full Sail university in their Mobile Development program.
The dates for these projects range from January 2012 to present day.
Some projects will not work anymore as their backend has been rendered non-existant but they should still demonstrate my growth as a programmer relatively accurately.
Classes will first be listed as their acronym and then their full name after an asterisk as needed. 

The Web projects and classes are my earliest ones which were completed between January 2012 and August of 2012.
The order in which these classes were taken are as follows:

- SDI
   *Scalable Data Infrstructures
- VFW
   *Visual Frameworks
- MIU
   *Mobile Interfaces and Usability
- ASD1 & ASD2
   *Advanced Scalable Data Infrastructures
- AVF
   *Advanced Visual Frameworks
   
The DH Prototype App and AASCultureSite both are stray web projects from during this part of the program.

The Objective C projects and classes started immediately after the Web part of my degree.  They were taken roughly between August of 2012 and May of 2013.
While some of them are available on here, there were a few classes where I did not upload the projects to GitHub.
These may or may not be added in the near future.
The Objective C classes were taken in the following order:

- AOC1
   *Apple Programming Language: Objective C 1
- AOC2
   *Apple Programming Language: Objective C 2
- MDF1
   Mobile Development Frameworks 1
- MUX(Not uploaded)
   *Mobile User Experience
- MDF2(Not uploaded)
   *Mobile Development Frameworks 2
- APD1(Not uploaded)
   *Application Deployment 1: iPhone and iPad

The Java classes are the most recently completed out of my degree.  They were taken between May 2013 and September of 2013.
One of the classes' project is currently held in a private repo.  Request access if you would like to view it.
The Java classes were taken in the following order:

- Java 1
- Java 2
- MDF3
   *Mobile Development Frameworks 3
- APD2(Private Repo)
   *Application Deployment 2: Android

Currently I am in the last leg of my schooling which consists of Cross Platform Development.
We have been learning about how to work with databases for both Android and iOS and about user experience when playing mobile games.
We will also be covering how to develop mobile games, market applications, and develop for multiple platforms at once in the coming months.

Classes covered in this block so far:

- MPX
   *Mobile Player Experience
