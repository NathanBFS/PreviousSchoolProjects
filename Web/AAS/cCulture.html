        <h3>A Short Introduction</h3>
        <p>In business situations with Koreans it is imperative to remember as much of their etiquette as possible.  Although the way dress etiquette is handled almost exactly the same as it is in Western cultures, the standards of which they hold things like business cards and even the way they interact and view legal documents differ greatly.  All in all, the success of a person of a different culture with people of the Korean culture depends on their learnability.</p>
        <h3>Dress</h3>
        <p>Dress etiquette is relatively simple.  If male, then a person should wear darker colored business suit with a white shirt.  Jewelry should be avoided with the exceptions of a watch or a wedding ring.  Females should dress conservatively and in darker colors as well.  These standards of dress are not unique to Korea, or any other country for that matter, and can be viewed as good examples that universal rationalization is not always inaccurate bad.</p>
        <h3>Business</h3>
        <p>Preparedness is crucial in this culture.  All meetings are required to be made within 3-4 weeks in advanced always.  Also all attendees should arrive on time to show respect for whoever they are meeting with.  First meetings typically will be centered on getting to know each other, while future meetings are used typically understand the needs of a client.  Even after the first appointment, meetings are used to build up the relationship.  Most business etiquette is based on whatever the most senior South Korean does.  If they remove their jacket then so can everybody else, if not then other people can’t. They also will usually be the first to enter the room.  As with any meeting with a different culture, a person wants to provide all documentation in English as well as Korean.  In Korea, business cards are held to high standards.  If not from Korea, then one side of a person’s card should be in Korean.   Whenever receiving a card a person wants to make sure that they accept and examine it carefully.  This is to show respect for the person who presented it.  If presenting a card, do so with both hands and with the Korean side facing the receiver so that they for sure can read it.  Never should a person write on another person’s card that they have received and they should always store received cards in business card case.</p>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Communication can get confusing between two cultures.  It is important first to know the subtext of the other culture.  For instance when addressing Koreans, a Westerner should avoid asking yes or no questions.  Koreans  often avoid answering a question with no, so sometimes when they say yes, it is more because they are forced into it than they actually agree.  Another form of subtext that can be easily missed is the signing of a contract.  Koreans hold contracts relatively loosely compared to how Western people do.  While people of the Western culture often view contracts as law, Koreans see them more as mementos of understanding.   In other words, they see a legal document as a broad agreement that is subject to change with the situation. Despite these two easily confusing situations, Koreans are typically quite direct with their statements or questions during a meeting and it is polite for a person from a different culture to enact similarly with them.</p>
