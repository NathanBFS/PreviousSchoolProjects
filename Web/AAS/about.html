                <p>The Republic of Korea or South Korea is a nation on the far-east edge of Asia that despite being troubled by the Korean War in the 50â€™s and a constant tension with North Korea has had enormous economic growth.  Its capital, Seoul, has one of the largest populations in the world.</p>
                <p>Its government is a Republic system in which a President is elected through direct popular vote.  A person that gets voted in as President can serve for only a single term of 5 years.  The power is divided in a similar manner as what the US is with three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.</p>
                <p>There is not a religion set by the government but its religious population is 46% non-affiliated, 26% Christian, 26% Buddhist, 1% Confucianist, and 1% other religions.</p>
