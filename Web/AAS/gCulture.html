        <h3>A Short Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Korean people are very complex culture that sets high standards for it people.   Family values are what come first in a Korean’s life and much of their culture is based on that aspect.  They also have a very specific etiquette whenever it comes to  eating, meeting each other, and sharing gifts.</p>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, family comes first in the Korean cultural grammar.  Much of it is based on traditions taken from Confucianism.  Confucianism is a system derived from Confucious’ views and teachings on the position of an individual in society.  The head of the house is the father and his duty is to make sure that everybody in the house is accounted for.  He provides necessities like food, clothing and shelter and is also the person who makes decisions about family members getting married.  In this system individuals make sacrifices for the better good of the family if need be and all actions made by one member affect the others, good or bad.  Deeper into family lines comes ancestry.  As a child a Korean is taught that no matter what they do, they will never be able to reciprocate their debt to their parents.  Due to this they hold ceremonies for their three prior generations to worship and honor their ancestors multiple times a year.  </p>
        <h3>Table Manners</h3>
        <p>Dining etiquette is where Korean culture can become quite complicated.  One of the customs that are most different between Korean dining and Western dining is that of tipping.  While in Western cultures it is often seen as rude to not leave a tip if the workers do a good job, in Korea it is often different.  Although tipping is accepted in some areas there are places where "No Tipping" signs will be set up.  Wherever these signs are at, it is considered rude to leave a tip.  The guest should always wait to be seated by the host, if they seat themselves then it is considered impolite.  With drinks it is customary for people to fill the cups of one another, even encouraged.  Often people will trade filling each other’s cups, if this is attempted and one refuses, it is considered an insult to the other.  Woman are allowed to fill their own cup, and the cups of men, but not the cup of another woman.  Typically the meal will be eaten without much conversation, socialization is for after the meal.  This socialization often entails people singing a song, any song, no matter how good or bad their voice is.  Also after dinner the host may invite a guest to go drinking.  The guest should accept this invitation gladly, to do otherwise can be seen as an insult to the host.</p>
        <h3>Meeting</h3>
        <p>The meeting between two people is very important and therefore in Korea follows a strict set of rules.  If at a social gathering, a guest should always wait to be introduced.  When being introduced a very precise set of actions will take place, starting with a bowing.  A person of lower status always bows first to the person of higher status.  It is proper for whichever person who initiates the bow to say pleased to meet you in Korean.  Often after the bowing, in order to blend cultures a handshake is done.  For the handshake it is always the person with the most seniority that starts it, even if the younger person has a higher status.  The way the handshake should be done in order to show respect to the other person is to support with the forearm of the right arm while shaking hands with the left hand.  Korean women will nod, but will not shake hands with a Westerner.  Western women may shake hands similarly with Korean men, but also do not shake hands with a Korean woman.  Whenever leaving a gathering, it is polite to bow and bid farewell to ever person individually.</p>
        <h3>Gifts</h3>
        As with many other cultures, gift giving is important but a unique ritual.  In Korea, reciprocating is important.  Since gifts have such great meaning behind them, to not give a gift to the giver is an insult.  That being said there are a few things to be considered when giving gifts to a Korean. Never wrap a gift in green, white, or black paper.  Use colors like yellow or red instead.  Also if giving multiple items, groupings of 4 should be avoided since it is seen as an unlucky number, 7 on the other hand is considered very lucky.  If giving a gift, a person should always be considerate and make certain that it is something that can be reciprocated without too much trouble.  Gifts should always be wrapped nicely.  If on the receiving end of a gift the person should accept it with both hands and open it later.
